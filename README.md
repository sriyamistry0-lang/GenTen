# GenTen: AMR Genomic Profiling & Patient-at-Risk Pipeline
A computational discovery tool designed to prioritize molecular targets for diagnostic validation and antimicrobial payload design.
Target Prioritization: Python-based workflow that filters genetic drivers from large-scale datasets (GEO) to optimize target selection for rapid detection.
scRNA_Analyzer: The host immune profile shows significant activation of the HLA-DR, CD83 + γδ T cell subset, a signature highly correlated with systemic neonatal sepsis. 
Data Sources: Utilizes NCBI Datasets and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to ensure statistically significant sample sizes.
Method: Raw GEO Data → Statistical Filtering → AMR Target Identification → Diagnostic Validation.
The pipeline is built using Python to allow for high-throughput, reproducible workflows.
# Future Applications
Extensibility to Live Biotherapeutic Products
This logic is designed to be adapted for:
Identifying antimicrobial payloads for engineered beneficial bacteria.
Monitoring host-microbiome interactions in bespoke in vitro biofilm models.
