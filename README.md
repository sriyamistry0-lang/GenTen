We will focus on  collating & analyzing genetic data on pediatric health issues particularly aiming those that will help in the war against Multi-Drug resistant microbes. Our code will help you study any GEO sepsis dataset with the help of statistical analysis packages. You can use these heatmaps for further data demonstrations!
The patient@RISK is a user-friendly code for medical practitioners to catch number of infected patients in the "at-risk" phase by using the combined data of NETosis and coagulation pathways.
